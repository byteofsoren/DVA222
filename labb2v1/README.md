# DVA222 Labb2

Lab 2 is about inheritance in c++ programming.
3 balls is created and sent flying on the screen.
There are different wall to block there way.
Depending on what type of wall that is
sett 3 different occurrences can happen.
Wall -1 ball bonces.
Wall 0  ball slow down
wall 1  ball speeds up.

So at the moment there is a new branch that i work on that has the goal to add a
vector of wall pointers to the ball class. That way I'm going to handle
collision internally.
